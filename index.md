I am a computer science major at CSUF and I am planning on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 


Lab 3, Part 2 

I enjoyed writing this code together with my lab partner because it helped me understand how functions can work together to solve a bigger problem. It was interesting to see how the Julian Day formula turned dates into numbers so that calculating the difference became simple subtraction. I liked practicing how to collect user input and then use it in different parts of the program. Even though some of the math in the formula was complicated at first, it felt rewarding when the output was correct. 

Lab 5, Part 1 

During the lab, I enjoyed seeing my program take user input and turn it into a real result. Printing the final answer makes the work feel rewarding because I can immediately see if I did everything correctly. Even small successes, like getting the right output, make me feel more confident. 

Lab 7, Part 1

I found this lab assignment enjoyable in particular because it helped me practice using if statements and logical operators in a more real-world manner. It was interesting to think about different parking rules and translate them into conditions that a computer can check. I also liked learning how to combine comparisons with the conditional logical operators to make more complex decisions. At first, it was confusing to figure out the correct time ranges, but I felt accomplished when the functions finally worked. Seeing each street have different rules made the assignment feel less repetitive.
